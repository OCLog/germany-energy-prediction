# Literature Review

## Overview

This project milestone requires you to review the literature related to your project. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain, as well as to identify similar approaches or solutions that have been tried before.
You might want to answer the following questions:
  * Which are the models commonly used for my problem?
  * Which format must the training data have?
  * How much training data is typically used in similar problems?
  * Are there pretrained models I can use for my problem?

## Guidelines

1. **Minimum Number of Sources**: You are required to review at least two or three papers, blogs, or authoritative sources related to your project topic.

1. **Summary**: For each work, provide a brief summary that includes the objective of the work, methods used, and the outcomes. One sentence on each point is sufficient.
